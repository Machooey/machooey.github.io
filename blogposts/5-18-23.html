                Hey again. Today I started learning Python using LinkedIn Learning. Not much learned so far, basically just the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebook.
                I wanted to learn Python as it's very good to have it in your arsenal, and there is so much about Python that makes it a lot of fun in my opinion. The 
                endless support it has with tons and tons of packages makes it a great language for pretty much anything, so I'm making the effort to learn it on my own.
                Those are just a few reasons why I want to learn Python. Anyways this is a short post as I only just began but expect more about my journey of learning Python
                in the near future.
            </p>
