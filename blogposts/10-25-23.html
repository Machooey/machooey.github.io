                Hello, it's been a while since I've updated my blog, about 4 months to be exact. I thought I'd write an update
                on how I'm doing and what I've been up to.

                To start, I've recently started my second year of university at Brandeis and am taking a few courses, including
                COSI 29a: Discrete Structures, and COSI 101b: Fundamentals of AI. I've been really enjoying these classes and have
                been learning a lot from both of them. I have also joined a couple of clubs on campus, mainly TAMID and Quant.
                Both of these clubs will help advance my COSI knowledge. TAMID gives me lessons in networking, practical
                programming, working in a team, and many other important topics, and eventually I will work with a team on real
                life projects with the club, which I'm really excited about. Quant allows me to start working with a team on
                research project early into the year. 
                
                Also, I've began working on a new personal project, which is a complete simulation of backgammon written in Java. 
                Java has been my comfort and go to language for a while, so I want to really create another big project that I 
                will be able to present my OOP and Java skills with. Eventually I want to convert it into Python where I will 
                create an AI bot to play the game and see if I can create one that's better than humans.

                Before coming to school, I learned a lot about networking (computers, not people) and computers through Google's 
                online courses, and learned a lot through AT&T's program as well.

                Overall, I've been doing great and have been feeling confident in myself and my future, and am excited to see
                what's next :)
