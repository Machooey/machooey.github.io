                First off, Happy New Years!!! Hello again, I'm here to share some more exciting news! Firstly, I finished my third semester at Brandeis with straight 
                A's, giving me a GPA of a 3.92 now :). I took two COSI classes this past semester: Discrete Structures, and Fundamentals of AI.
                I learned a lot in both of them and am very proud of the work I produced in the AI class. I made an AI that can read a handwritten
                equation (it only reads the characters [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, +, -, /, *]) and return an output! The code is right 
                <a href="https://github.com/adameheaney/AI-Equation-Solver">here</a>. It was supposed to be a group project by my groupmates didn't
                help with the code unfortunately (if you're reading this and were one of my groupmates, it's all good I really enjoyed figuring out the code on my own :D)
                Anyways, the semester went really well academically (had a few mishaps socially but that's okay) and I'm hoping for a good next semester too.
                <br><br>
                In my most recent blogpost I mentioned how I was recreating backgammon in Java. Well, after hours of figuring out the
                logic, how to organize my code, and reading up on backgammon rules, I finally finished recreating backgammon! It is currently
                playable in the terminal, and the code for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/adameheaney/backgammon-game">here</a>.
                This was a really fun project that taught me how to utilize the OOP principles that I was taught in my classes, and also how to 
                approach building logic and a game through the terminal.
                <br><br>
                This semester I also finished the education track of TAMID and I learned a lot and met great people! Hopefully next semester I will
                get the chance to work on a real project alongside those new friends I made.
                <br><br>
                The internship application process is tough, but I'm working on it and have been making progress. Perhaps I'll end up in Israel this
                upcoming semester, or staying by Brandeis. Who knows? At the end of the day we're just gonna have to find out. Anyways signing out -Adam
