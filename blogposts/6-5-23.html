                It's been a while since I've written here, but I've been making some real progress with my Python course using LinkedIn Learning!
                Within the course I learned the basics of Python such as declaring and using variables, writing methods, control flow, and list 
                comprehensions, which are a Python exclusive! Since I am very knowledgeable of another programming language (Java), it wasn't so
                difficult for me to pick up on Python, and so I got started on my first project fairly quickly:
                </br></br>   
                I would like to introduce the <a href = "https://github.com/adameheaney/ascii-camera"> ASCII Camera! </a>which is a Python application
                which converts your computer's internal webcam into an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII</a> picture. With this
                project I learned a lot about organization and structure of code in Python, and more importantly the versatility of packages that Python
                offers. In this project the main package I utilized was cv2, which is a Python adaptation of OpenCV, to retrieve, downscale, and convert 
                the webcam's recording into ASCII art using a clever trick with the amount of pixels in each ASCII character (for example, "@" is more "dense"
                than "7"). 
                </br></br>
                Python has been a lot of fun to learn, and although there are some hurtles to jump, I am enjoying the challenge andhave been loving the language.
                Expect more updates on my Python progress in the near future. Oh and heres a picture of the ASCII Camera in use:
